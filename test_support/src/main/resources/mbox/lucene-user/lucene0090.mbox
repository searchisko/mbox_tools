Ok sorry for not explaining my problem clearly earlier. We have around 5
fields in each document. ID, ISBN, author, title  and the category which
this book falls under. ( You are right about point 3, we are indeed storing
multiple genre against the book, which means 1 book 1 doc.)

doc.add(new Field("entityId", book.get("id"), Field.Store.YES,
Field.Index.NO));
doc.add(new Field("author", book.get("author"), Field.Store.NO,
Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
etc etc... and this document is added using the IndexWriter.

and when a search is issued we search for the search term in
title/author/isbn/category....based on some inputs... then a set of books
are returned( you are right about point 2 as well... since we search only on
title/author/genre, we were only indexing those ). The way we wanted these
books to be laid out to the user was such that he can navigate through the
categories, which the books he searched for belong to, to kind of being able
to narrow the search. 

While the count of books, for the given search term, under a particular
category was correct, the overall count of the books were incorrect because
of some books being repeated in various categories. For this reason, we
wanted a duplicate filter on the ID which would give us only the unique
books... and there was something wrong in the way it was implemented... the
ID in the document was not indexed as you can see in the above code. When
this was fixed it worked as expected...but for some performance issues..
because of the huge index sizes ( 3 million books ). Anyway looks like we
have figured the solution ( moved the filter out of the search.. applied it
on the result or something like that ) Thanks so much for ur time.
